**POST SCARCITY** -and- **PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE**

## Post Scarcity - people are not fighting for materials (like food.) Common for an
  industrial society to be in post scarcity - people are not hungry.

## Planned Obsolescence - Practice of producing good with intentionally weak or
  ineffective components creating a device with short useful lives.
  Devices which become broken or obsolete very easily.
  
  1. **Contrived Durability**
    - Designing a product to break down quickly
    - Using cheap parts
  
  2. **Prevention of Repairs**
    - Physical
    - Legal
  
  3. **Style Obsolescence**
    - Wood grain PT cruiser
    - Top Teen has to own the Latest (apple)
    
  4. **Systematic Obsolescence**
    - Alter the system so that it becomes less useful over time.
    - Driving a particular system out of service/support (No updates!)
    - Abandon-ware
   
  5. **Programmed Obsolescence**
    - Writing into the system's computer code, a method by which the system
      degrades or slows down over time.
      - Apple (Inefficient use of battery.)
      
## Pro's and Con's of Planned Obsolescence:

  PRO's
    1. People buy more stuff
    2. More goods coming out faster, decreasing the value of older goods
    3. The economy keeps rolling along (When buyers are buying, the economy
       is doing well!)
  CON's
    1. HIGH wastage, bordering on ENCOURAGING waste.
    2. Takes advantage of the consumer. (Convincing them, influencing their
       choices, basically open manipulation and nearly theft.)
    
## Looking into Trevor's **"Hacker Toolkit"**

  - Digital Multimeter    Princess Auto      (Reads electrical current)
  - Sauter Iron
  - Tiny-head Screwdriver Set (Jeweler's Kit Presented as Example)
  - Pliers
  - Wire Stripper         Princess Auto
  - Breadboard
  - Arduino
  - Misc. extra wires
  - Duct Tape

Now we just rub Hank the octopus on our nips for a while...

Saw an IC (Integrated Circuit), and some Resistors

Saw the factory test pads inside of an octopus.
  - These will be looked at in more detail in future classes *
