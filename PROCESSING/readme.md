# PROCESSING

This folder contains all projects started and / or finished using processing
during the duration of the class. These vary from completely useless examples
of code to genuinely useful tools / rendering solutions.

See below for more details on the individual projects.

## clock-thingy

The first thing I have written in processing. I took a challenge from the
[processing code challenge subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/processing/comments/4acjwd/processing_weekly_challenge_1_light_switch/)
and from there just started writing. I used [official processing documentation](https://processing.org/reference/)
and the PROCESSING > FILE > EXAMPLES window to learn how to use the language.
I learned that it might be a good idea to learn some basic Java/JS syntax.

This is at best an example of what some code can do. The project contains
2 classes (Clock, Man) and 12 total functions including processing's own
setup() and display().
