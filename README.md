# CS 207 - Justyn Chaykowski

This repository contains all open sourced course project code,as well as codified class notes, and tools created with
relevant applications. These sub-projects are divided into their particular language's sub-directory, while OTHER/
stores anything which was useful to but not directly connected to course content and is not subdivided by language.

Each folder contains extra content directly relevant to it's subject and is further described in it's own README.

TODO: Add examples?

Folder's marked by two preceding numbers `a01some_folder/ ; a02some_other_folder` contain class assignments and
projects. NOTE: None of these exist quite yet!

All other folders `PROCESSING/ ; PYTHON/ ; NOTES/; OTHER;` contain their title's language or other core purpose
outlined above. Notes are codified in Python 3.6
