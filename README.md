Project library, all individual tools and projects are stored in their own
folder's - including class NOTES ("./NOTES").

### PROCESSING/
**Filetypes**: Processing Sketches + Distributables

Contains every project completed and in progress using processing during
the duration of the semester. Many code examples from my own experiementation,
resources for learning, functional code snippits, and anything else pertaining
to Processing that I feel like making public.

See inside for more details.

### file-parser-UA
**Filetypes**: Python, .txt

Contains a list of all the PROCESSING and JAVA keywords to add custom keywords
or create a custom syntax in notepad++ for PROCESSING editing in notepad++.

A small python script used for one very particular use. This could serve as a
basis for a custom file parser script for future parsing needs. Who doesn't love
command line ops? See folder contents for more info

### mvgit
**Filetypes**: bash (*NIX Systems or any BASH terminal on Windows)

MOVE OR COPY git repositories on local hard drive. Handle's the removal of .git 
files allowing for the safe and easy relocation of git repositories and most
other folders. This should prove useful!
