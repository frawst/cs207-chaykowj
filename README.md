# CS 207 - Justyn Chaykowski

This repository contains all open sourced course project code,as well as codified class notes, and tools created with
relevant applications. These sub-projects are divided into their particular language's sub-directory, while OTHER/
stores anything which was useful to but not directly connected to course content and is not subdivided by language.

Each folder contains extra content directly relevant to it's subject and is further described in it's own README.

This repo will be shared publicly with those wanting to learn
and will include educational fragments and idea's that I find as I take my own
journey of learning that some might be able to follow in my footsteps for a bit
of direction as they learn with me! Do with this as you will!

Keep in mind that this repo is an imperfect use-case of git and you should refine
your management process according to your own use cases.
