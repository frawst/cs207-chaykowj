## Contents

### ./
**Filetypes**: .txt, .md

Project library, all individual tools and projects are stored in their own
folder's - including class NOTES ("./NOTES").

### PROCESSING/
**Filetypes**: Processing Sketches + Distributables

Contains every project completed and in progress using processing during
the duration of the semester which are not a part of class assignments.
Many code examples from my own experiementation, resources for learning,
functional code snippits, and anything else pertaining to Processing 
that I feel like making public.

See inside for more details.

**Includes DEMO for MORSE CODE CONVERTER**

### file-parser-UA
**Filetypes**: Python, .txt

Contains a list of all the PROCESSING and JAVA keywords to add custom keywords
or create a custom syntax in notepad++ for PROCESSING editing in notepad++.

A small python script used for one very particular use. This could serve as a
basis for a custom file parser script for future parsing needs. Who doesn't love
command line ops? See folder contents for more info

### mvgit
**Filetypes**: bash (*NIX Systems or any BASH terminal on Windows)

MOVE OR COPY git repositories on local hard drive. Handle's the removal of .git 
files allowing for the safe and easy relocation of git repositories and most
other folders. This should prove useful!

### CS207/

All projects and misc. code created specifically for assignments in CS207.

### CS205/

All projects and misc. code created specifically for assignments in CS205.
