# File-Parser

This script was specifically designed to strip contents of the keyword
list for PROCESSING language, in order to add the unique processing keywords
to the keyword list for JAVA in Notepad++.

"output.txt" contains the returned output from "editme.txt".

## How is this useful?

Lines 1-174 of "output.txt" can be copied to:
Notepad++ > Settings > Style Configurator > Java > INSTRUCTION WORD > User-defined keywords

this will add the PROCESSING keywords to the Java language definition.

Alternatively, the keyword list could be used to create a USER-DEFINED-LAUNGAUGE
through:
Notepad++ > Language > Define Your Language

in order to create an entirely unique PROCESSING language definition in npp.
